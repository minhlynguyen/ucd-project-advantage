cd django-backend-project
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Front-end Environment Configuration

### 1. JavaScript runtime environment

Make sure you have installed Node.js and npm in your computer. You can check it by type the command in the terminal:
check Node.js

```
node -v
```

check npm (Node Package Manager)

```
npm -v
```

If not installed yet, here is the official website:
https://nodejs.org/en

For this project, recommended version is Node.js (v18.15.0) and npm (9.5.0).

### 2. Install dependencies of project

All dependencies for front-end part are listed in `/website/react-app/package.json`.
Go to front-end folder (`/website/react-app`) and install all dependencies.

```
cd ./website/react-app/
npm install
```

### 3. Run

after installing all the dependencies, we can run the dev environment.

```
cd ./website/react-app/
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build for deployment

you can now build the frontend for deployment.

```
npm run build
```

This will create a folder called dist with all static files that need to be served

## Back-end Environment Configuration

### 1. Database Setup

NOTE: For the fully functional database migrations, your database should be POSTGRESQL with PostGIS extension.
Configure your database settings in settings.py and perform the initial migration to set up the database schema:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Run the Development Server:

Start the development server to run the project locally:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Access the backend application

Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/api/ to access the API endpoints provided by the backend.
